A quick hack spi test for gumstix overo.

Tested with 2.6.34

Doesn't do anything useful without a scope or signal analyzer also.

Uses an hrtimer to trigger spi writes on at a fixed rate.

Watch SPI1.CS0 with a scope.

# insmod scrap.ko
# echo start > /dev/scrap
... watch with scope
# echo stop > /dev/scrap


If you read from the module, you'll get the number of spi writes
# cat /dev/scrap
running : 24175 spi writes


There is no error checking in this driver. It was only written for one-off
debugging session of another problem where we weren't sure if it was code
or hardware.

Take from it if you find something useful.
