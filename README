A quick hack spi test for some gumstix overo debugging.

Tested with 2.6.34

Doesn't do anything useful without a scope or signal analyzer also.

Uses an hrtimer to trigger spi writes on at a fixed rate.

Watch SPI1.CS0 with a scope.

# insmod scrap.ko
# echo start > /dev/scrap
... watch with scope
# echo stop > /dev/scrap


If you read from the module, you'll get the number of spi completion callbacks
and the number of timer callbacks. They should be the same +/- 1.
# cat /dev/scrap
running : spi 39709  timer 39708


There is no error checking in the driver. It was written for one-off debug
session for tracking down another problem.

Take from it if you find something useful, but don't consider it production
type code.
